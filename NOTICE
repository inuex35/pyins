The algorithms implemented in this software, particularly those related to:
- GNSS positioning calculations
- RTK double difference processing
- Satellite orbit computations
- Time system conversions
- Coordinate transformations

are based on standard GNSS processing techniques as documented in scientific literature
and implemented in open-source software packages, especially RTKLIB.

We acknowledge the significant contributions of these projects to the GNSS community.
